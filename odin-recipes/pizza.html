        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>To make a classic pizza, start by preparing the dough with flour, yeast, warm water, salt, and olive oil,
            then
            knead it and let it rise for about 1 to 2 hours. While the dough rises, make a simple tomato sauce by
            simmering
            crushed tomatoes with garlic, olive oil, salt, and Italian herbs like oregano and basil. Once the dough is
            ready, roll it out into your desired shape, spread the sauce evenly over the surface, and top it with
            shredded
            mozzarella cheese and any toppings you like, such as pepperoni, vegetables, or olives. Bake the assembled
            pizza
            in a preheated oven at 475°F (245°C) for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is
            bubbly
            and slightly browned. Let it cool slightly before slicing and serving.</p>
